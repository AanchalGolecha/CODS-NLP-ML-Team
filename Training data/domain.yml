  - text: In light of recent publications of evidence on the safety and efficacy of
      hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients, the Executive Group
      of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine
      arm within the trial as a precaution while the safety data is being reviewed.As
      an example, an observational study published in the Lancet on 22 May found that,
      among 100 000 patients from multiple countries randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine,
      when used alone or with a macrolide, there was a higher mortality rate and an
      increased frequency of irregular heartbeats.A final decision on the harm, benefit
      or lack of benefit of hydroxychloroquine will be made once the evidence has
      been reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. This review will include
      data from the Solidarity Trial and other ongoing trials, as well as any evidence
      published so far. It is expected by mid-June.
  utter_hcq2:
  - text: Those patients previously randomized to hydroxychloroquine treatment should
      continue to receive hydroxychloroquine until they finish their course of treatment.
      The use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe
      for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.
  utter_hcq3:

      within the Solidarity Trial. The hydroxychloroquine arm has been paused as a
      precaution while the safety data is being reviewed.Every country, particularly
      those with regulatory authorities, is in a position to advise its citizens regarding
      the use of any drug. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are already
      licensed products for treating other diseases, at this stage, these drugs have
      not been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. In fact, warnings
      have been issued by many national authorities on the side effects of the drugs
      and their use has been limited in many countries to clinical trials under strict
      supervision in hospital settings.WHO has cautioned physicians against recommending
      or administering unproven treatments to COVID-19 patients, and cautioned people
      against self-medicating with them. The consensus among world experts is that
      the potential exists but that far more studies are urgently needed to determine
      if existing antiviral drugs can be effective to treat COVID-19. If these treatments
      prove to be effective, they could reduce the burden of COVID-19. '

      effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped
      that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around
      the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. Based on data from laboratory
      and clinical studies, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir with
      Interferon beta-1a, and hydroxychloroquine had been initially selected as treatment
      options. Following new evidence on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine
      as a treatment for hospitalized  COVID-19 patients, enrollment for this drug
      was temporarily suspended on 24 May 2020.Over 100 countries have expressed an
      interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than
      60 of them, including with the following:ethical and regulatory approvals of
      the WHO core protocol;identification of hospitals participating in the trial;training
      of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system;shipping
      the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.To date, over 400
      hospitals in 35 countries are actively recruiting patients and nearly 3500 patients
      have been enrolled from 17 countries.An interim trial analysis will be produced

      persons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart
      disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, appear to develop serious illness
      more often than others. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about
      how it affects children and adolescents. Evidence to date suggests that children

      The virus is spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose
      or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks.
      These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected

      with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to
      operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19

      if these check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 outbreak.
      Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment
      of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other
      chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions
      and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic

      be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,  vaccines provided to adolescents
      have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in
      time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that
      requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and
      the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between
      doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer.
      It is most important hat you receive the t second dose at some point in time
      to be fully protected. Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are
      made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can
      get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important
      you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed
      due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more:https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331590/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-2020.1-eng.pdf

      \ activity outdoors while keeping a distance from others. For those who are\
      \ unable to leave the house, you could open the window for fresh air and do\
      \ some indoor exercises to stay active. Don’t use smoking, eating, alcohol or\

      be spending even more hours online than before. While online solutions provide
      huge opportunities for continuing your learning, socializing and playing, you
      should try to limit the amount of screen time that is not related to your studies
      or physical activity. This is because you need to be physically active to keep
      healthy and a positive attitude. In addition, some people are sensitive to flickering
      lights and may get headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and even seizures if they
      spend too much time in front of a screen. Therefore it is important to replace
      some of the recreational screen time with non-screen activities, like listening
      to music, reading, playing board games, and physical activity, like  going for
      a walk or jog. Excessive gaming can lead to “gaming disorder” that leads to
      reduced sleep or day-night reversal, loss of appetite, aggression, headaches,

      you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more
      time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online
      predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams
      wear appropriate clothing and do not connect with teachers or virtual classrooms

      for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at
      greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of
      cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online

      become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action.   If you are worried
      about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted
      adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a
      fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting
      hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates.
      This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents
      and electric charger, and having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified
      to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons.
      Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who
      can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and
      social services.  In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19,
      essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services.
      If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country
      may have helplines, including text services so that you can communicate with
      someone who can help you or give you advice. Read more: https://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2020/issue-brief-covid-19-and-ending-violence-against-women-and-girls-en.pdf?la=en&vs=5006

      household bleach to 49 parts of water). Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for
      surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent
      first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start
      from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in
      order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant
      solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered
      area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared
      every day.In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces
      via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19. If disinfectants are to be applied,
      these should be via a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant.
  utter_on_cleaning3:

      and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces
      and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public
      spaces).Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures
      can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases.Keep children,
      pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is
      dry and there is no odour. Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away
      from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always
      be prepared in well-ventilated areas.Wash your hands after using any disinfectant,
      including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and
      accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children
      to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the
      reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks
      if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.Do not use disinfectant
      wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.The minimum recommended personal protective
      equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof
      aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed
      to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.Note:
      Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource
      limitations, frequent hand washing and avoiding touching the face should be
      the primary prevention approaches to reduce any potential transmission associated

      Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19.
      Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and
      cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.This practice will be ineffective
      since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant,
      and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is
      even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways.
      Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying
      would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate
      pathogens.

      or chamber) is not recommended under any circumstances. This practice could
      be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s
      ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who
      is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as
      soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the
      virus.  The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals
      can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially
      gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health
      safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent

      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
      Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing
      outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing
      their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
      for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading
      COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your
      hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why?
      Washing your hands with soap andwater or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
      viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre distance between
      yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray
      small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
      are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,    including the COVID-19 virus
      if the person has the disease.Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people
      come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with
      someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance
      of 1 metre.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces
      and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to
      your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect
      you.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
      you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your
      hands. Why? Droplets    spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene,
      you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay
      home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild
      fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave
      your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with
      others will    protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.If you
      have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call
      by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local
      health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up
      to date information    on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
      allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
      This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep
      up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your
      local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are
      best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect
      themselves.

      (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO
      is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously
      updates its guidance. Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care
      settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical
      masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures
      such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. Healthcare workersWhy? Medical
      masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and
      should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Close
      contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding
      environment are the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers
      are the most exposed. People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19Why?
      Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore
      throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to
      WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing,
      sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection.
      These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding
      environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while wearing a
      medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from infection.If a sick
      person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask. Anyone
      taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 Why? Those caring
      for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection.
      Again, close, frequent and prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts
      caretakers at high risk. National decision makers may also choose to recommend
      medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach
      takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability
      of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the types of masks to
      be considered.

      the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).Place the mask
      to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to
      the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and
      your chin.Do not touch the mask while you are wearing it for protection.After
      use, take off the mask with clean hands; remove the elastic loops from behind
      the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching
      potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed
      bin immediately after use. Do not reuse the mask.Perform hand hygiene after
      touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly
      soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.Be aware that there is a global
      shortage of medical masks (both surgical masks and N95 masks). These should
      be reserved as much as possible for health care workers. Remember that  masks
      are not a substitute for other, more effective ways to protect yourself and
      others against COVID-19 such as frequently washing your hands, covering your
      cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1

  - text: Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some
      of which havebeen included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful
      guidance in the currentscenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into
      account the type of health careresource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic.
      That is, while the ethical principles thatapply to resource allocation might
      be the same in different pandemics, they can lead todifferent decisions, given
      contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears tosignificantly
      impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics
      arerelevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19.
      As a result, itmay be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that
      have age cut-offs thatdeprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.When
      applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the
      extent towhich resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be
      inappropriate, forinstance, to exclude population groups from being allocated
      a resource (for example,ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity
      remains. When resources are scarce,though – when there is an insufficient supply
      to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocationshould be guided by well established,
      broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there arecharacteristics of the
      outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevantcharacteristics
      of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should playno
      role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment
      to treatingpeople with equal respect.
  utter_on_resource2:
  - text: Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different
      resources may findethical justifications in different principles or values.
      For instance, once a novel vaccine isfound to be safe and effective, to prioritize
      those at highest risk, as well as populations likehealth care workers who may
      be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.Within those
      subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may bejustified,
      given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits
      will bederived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however,
      for otherresources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly
      more benefitthan others.
  utter_on_resource3:

      including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table:Ethical
      considerations when deciding who to prioritizePrincipleDescriptionPractice implicationEqualityEach
      person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify
      the differential prioritization of resources.Irrelevant characteristics
      of individuals, such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not
      serve arbitrarily as the basis for the differential allocation of resources.This
      principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery –
      that is, randomly by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May
      be most appropriate to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals
      or populations who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource,
      for example, vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among those
      with similar clinical indicators for benefit.Best outcomes (utility)This principle
      can be used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity
      to do the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available
      resources to save the most lives possible.May be most appropriate
      to guide the allocation of scarce resources that confer substantially different
      benefits to different individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected
      to derive the most benefit.Prioritize the worst offThis principle can be used
      to justify the allocation of resources to those in greatest medical need or
      those most at risk.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources
      that are designed or intended to protect those at risk, for example, PPE for
      health care workers, vaccines for those most at risk of infection and severe
      illness, or those most in need, as in the case of provision
      of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.Prioritize those
      tasked with helping othersThis principle can be used to justify the allocation
      of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many
      other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation
      in helping others.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources
      to health care workers, first responders, etc.Allocation principles may be relevant
      or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to
      more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of
      resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the    principle of first
      come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources
      become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a
      principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,    a
      principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified.
      At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come,
      first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals within
      a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar needs,
      or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources,
      or among those that are at similar levels of risk).In addition, multiple principles
      may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme
      for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most
      at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping    others,
      which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers.

      to deliberationsabout how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate
      some disagreement, becausedifferent people may weigh the values differently.
      Some may prioritize equality while othersmight put more emphasis on best outcomes
      or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason,it is imperative that the
      different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issuesusing a
      fair process.A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain
      ethical values:Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their
      justifications shouldbe made public. This means that the population should be
      informed about the criteriaguiding the decisions.Inclusiveness. Those affected
      by allocation decisions – including individuals,communities or countries – should
      be able to exert at least some influence over thedecision-making process as
      well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 4should be open
      to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appealprocess. Consistency.
      Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categoriesare
      treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one’s own family,religious
      or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms ofcorruption
      that are at variance with this principle should be challenged andcondemned.
      Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable
      forthose decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held
      responsible forthem. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not
      be made byindividuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case
      of allocationbetween countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines
      and therapiesshould not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.The
      fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because
      it is fair.However, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders
      solidarity and trust,which are vital to the successful and sustained collective
      response necessary for dealingeffectively with any outbreak.

      of resource ownership and the prioritization of compatriots. Vaccines should

      other criticalresources should receive some priority in receiving those resources
      because they havealso helped save others by their participation. This is not
      an absolute priority – forexample, it should not take precedence over giving
      priority to those most at risk in thecase of resources such as vaccines.While
      the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocatingresources
      in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,it
      is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution
      centre,those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.Younger
      populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.Consequently,
      the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, butperhaps
      may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical careresources.The
      allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in differentprinciples
      or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,a
      lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old
      andthose with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.Maximizing
      utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:centralizing
      the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits tomore
      people, but may exclude isolated populations and challenge our concern forthose

      patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir

      were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment

      water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally,
      rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.  Additional
      resources for best practices for environmental cleaning can be found in the
      following two documents: 1) Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and
      pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care2) Best Practices
      for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings
      which was developed by CDC and ICAN in collaboration with WHO'

  - text: To date there is no epidemiological information to suggestthat contact with
      goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affectedcountries have been
      the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection
      recommendationsfor any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries
      given thatthere is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to
      publichealth. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution ofCOVID-19,
      and will update the recommendations as needed.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers3:
  - text: Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or
      confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should
      wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection
      (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in
      a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers
      should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue.
      Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of
      coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available
      evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased
      risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers4:
  - text: No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic
      COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In
      general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion.
      Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to
      prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As
      precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those
      with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days,
      or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with
      a confirmed COVID-19 case.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers5:
  - text: No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV
      acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet
      precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used
      by all HCW for all patients.In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions
      include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile,
      long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect
      nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g.,    goggles, face shield), before entering
      the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients
      are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating
      procedures.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers6:
  - text: Disposable medical face masks are intended for a single use only. After
      use they should be removed using appropriate techniques (i.e. do no touch the
      front, remove by pulling the elastic ear straps or laces from behind) and disposed
      of immediately in an infectious waste bin with a lid, followed by hand hygiene.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers7:
  - text: WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international
      experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission
      of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and
      contact with contaminated surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine
      airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with
      other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g.,
      tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus    WHO recommends airborne precautions
      for these procedures.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers8:
  - text: No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not
      have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently
      there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals
      prevents 2019-nCoV transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic
      persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious
      issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually
      need to wear them. In health care facilities where health care workers are directly
      taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients,
      masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along
      with other PPE and hand hygiene.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers9:
  - text: Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients
      should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g.,
      limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients
      with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses,
      hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV
      infection. A minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at
      all times.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers10:
  - text: Mildly infected patients can be treated at hoem. For patients who have mild illness,
      e.g., low-grade fever, cough, malaise,rhinorrhoea, sore throat without any warning signs,
      such as shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, increased respiratory (i.e. sputum 
      or haemoptysis),gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and
      without changes in mental status, hospitalization may not be required unless
      there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. All patients discharged home
      should be instructed to return to hospital if they develop any worsening
      of illness.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers11:
  - text: Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive
      use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV
      acute respiratory disease patients. However, countries or local jurisdictions
      may choose to care for patients at such hospitals if those are deemed the most
      likely to be able to safely care for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV
      infection or for other clinical reasons (e.g., availability of advanced life
      support). Regardless, any healthcare facility treating patients with suspected
      or confirmed 2019-nCoV patients should adhere to the WHO infection prevention
      and control recommendations for healthcare to protect patients, staff and visitors.

  - text: Environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients
      with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should use disinfectants that
      are active against enveloped viruses, such as 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses.
      There are many disinfectants,    including commonly used hospital disinfectants,
      that are active against enveloped viruses. Currently WHO recommendations include
      the use of:70% Ethyl alcohol to disinfect reusable dedicated equipment (e.g.,
      thermometers) between usesSodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000ppm) for
      disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in homes or healthcare facilitiesClick
      here for the guidance on clinical management of severe acute respiratory
      infection when novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection is suspected.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers13:
  - text: There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data
      from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in
      the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity,
      and surface type. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence around nCoV and
      will update when such evidence is available.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers14:
  - text: Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with
      suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious
      waste.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers15:
  - text: There are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons
      who have died from 2019-nCoV. Authorities and medical facilities should proceed
      with their existing policies and regulations that guide post-mortem management
      of persons who died from infectious diseases.
  utter_on_healthcareworkers16:
  - text: 'A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development.
      PPE specifications for healthcare workers caring for nCoV patients can be found  in
      the disease commodity package at: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov)'
  utter_on_healthcareworkers17:
  - text: Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk
      of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine
      solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there
      is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing
      chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with
      varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored
      at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In
      comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned
      health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat
      or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface
      membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus.
