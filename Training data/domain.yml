  - text: In light of recent publications of evidence on the safety and efficacy of
      hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients, the Executive Group
      of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine
      arm within the trial as a precaution while the safety data is being reviewed.As
      an example, an observational study published in the Lancet on 22 May found that,
      among 100 000 patients from multiple countries randomized to receive hydroxychloroquine,
      when used alone or with a macrolide, there was a higher mortality rate and an
      increased frequency of irregular heartbeats.A final decision on the harm, benefit
      or lack of benefit of hydroxychloroquine will be made once the evidence has
      been reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board. This review will include
      data from the Solidarity Trial and other ongoing trials, as well as any evidence
      published so far. It is expected by mid-June.
  utter_hcq2:
  - text: Those patients previously randomized to hydroxychloroquine treatment should
      continue to receive hydroxychloroquine until they finish their course of treatment.
      The use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe
      for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.
  utter_hcq3:
  - text: 'WHO is currently assessing the use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients
      within the Solidarity Trial. The hydroxychloroquine arm has been paused as a
      precaution while the safety data is being reviewed.Every country, particularly
      those with regulatory authorities, is in a position to advise its citizens regarding
      the use of any drug. Although hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are already
      licensed products for treating other diseases, at this stage, these drugs have
      not been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. In fact, warnings
      have been issued by many national authorities on the side effects of the drugs
      and their use has been limited in many countries to clinical trials under strict
      supervision in hospital settings.WHO has cautioned physicians against recommending
      or administering unproven treatments to COVID-19 patients, and cautioned people
      against self-medicating with them. The consensus among world experts is that
      the potential exists but that far more studies are urgently needed to determine
      if existing antiviral drugs can be effective to treat COVID-19. If these treatments
      prove to be effective, they could reduce the burden of COVID-19. '
  utter_hcq4:
  - text: 'The Solidarity Trial is an international clinical trial to help find an
      effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped
      that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical
      outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around
      the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. Based on data from laboratory
      and clinical studies, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir with
      Interferon beta-1a, and hydroxychloroquine had been initially selected as treatment
      options. Following new evidence on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine
      as a treatment for hospitalized  COVID-19 patients, enrollment for this drug
      was temporarily suspended on 24 May 2020.Over 100 countries have expressed an
      interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than
      60 of them, including with the following:ethical and regulatory approvals of
      the WHO core protocol;identification of hospitals participating in the trial;training
      of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system;shipping
      the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.To date, over 400
      hospitals in 35 countries are actively recruiting patients and nearly 3500 patients
      have been enrolled from 17 countries.An interim trial analysis will be produced
      and will be monitored by an independent group of experts as the global Data
      and Safety Monitoring Committee. '

      is a medication used to prevent and treat malaria in areas where malaria remains
      sensitive to chloroquine.Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination
      with a second-generation macrolide, were widely used for treatment of COVID-19,

      how COVID-19 affects people, older persons (e.g. persons over 60 years) and
      persons with pre-existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, heart
      disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes, appear to develop serious illness
      more often than others. As this is a new virus, we are still learning about
      how it affects children and adolescents. Evidence to date suggests that children
      and adolescents are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases and
      death can still happen in these age groups.Read more:https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/key-messages-and-actions-for-covid-19-prevention-and-control-in-schools-march-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=baf81d52_4https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses

      the virus to other people, even if  they have mild symptoms or do not feel ill.
      The virus is spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose
      or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes or speaks.
      These droplets can land on objects and surfaces. People can then become infected
      by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching their eyes, nose or
      mouth.

      is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor
      your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.   Avoiding contact
      with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to
      operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19
      and other viruses. Seek medical care if your health gets worse, or if there
      is no one in your family that can take care of you at home. It is important
      that you follow the procedures put in place by your country. Ask a family member

      is confirmed as having COVID-19, you must be prepared that you and other known

      recommended check-ups.  Check with your health authorities and health provider
      if these check-ups should be done differently during the COVID-19 outbreak.
      Some services, such as counselling, may be available remotely. For treatment
      of clinically stable adolescents with HIV and adolescents with TB and/or other
      chronic conditions, your health provider should consider multi-month prescriptions
      and dispensing which will reduce the frequency of your visits to the clinic

      be postponed during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,  vaccines provided to adolescents
      have sufficiently flexible schedules to make sure you can get the vaccine in
      time when vaccination services start again. For example, the HPV vaccine that
      requires two doses can be started any time between 9 and 14 years of age and
      the interval between the two doses can be longer. The minimum interval between
      doses is 6 months, but it can be 12 or 15 months and, if necessary, even longer.
      It is most important hat you receive the t second dose at some point in time
      to be fully protected. Decisions to continue routine vaccination services are
      made by each country. Ask a family member or another trusted adult how you can
      get information about vaccination services where you live.  It is important
      you get the vaccines you are supposed to get, even if they have to be delayed
      due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more:https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331590/WHO-2019-nCoV-immunization_services-2020.1-eng.pdf

      \ especially if you don’t feel well. When your life is disrupted, it is normal\
      \ to have many different feelings: worry, frustration, sad, stress, anger, anxiety\

      \ help you manage your emotions. Here are a few examples:Keep a diary Express\
      \ your feelings through art, like writing a poem, drawing, dancing, or playing\
      \ music Talk about your feelings and concerns with someone you trust Try some\
      \ breathing exercises. You may find guided breathing exercises online if you\

      \ help, as it reduces levels of the body's stress hormones, which can help your\
      \ body and mind relax. Exercise also produces a “feel good hormone” called endorphins\
      \ which can help to improve your mood. Try taking a walk, running, or any physical\
      \ activity outdoors while keeping a distance from others. For those who are\
      \ unable to leave the house, you could open the window for fresh air and do\
      \ some indoor exercises to stay active. Don’t use smoking, eating, alcohol or\
      \ other drugs to deal with your emotions. Stay connected with friends and family\
      \ either by communicating with them by phone or internet if you can., If you\
      \ live close to them and the local rules allow you to, you could also talk to\

      have made by not seeing your friends and by stopping going to school and other
      activities are your contributions to fighting the pandemic. By putting societies
      and economies on hold, we have reduced the ability of the virus to spread through
      our communities. These defensive measures have helped to limit some of the short-term

      to be aware of some of the risks. First, be careful what content you share online.
      Risky behaviour, such as sexting or sharing of sexualized content, can expose
      you to risks of blackmail, harassment and humiliation. Second, spending more
      time online may increase the chances that you could come into contact with online
      predators who seek to sexually exploit young people. When in front of webcams
      wear appropriate clothing and do not connect with teachers or virtual classrooms
      from a bedroom. In addition, it’s important to note that some adolescents –
      for example those with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at
      greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 - may be at increased risk of
      cyberbullying and discrimination. Hurtful, discriminatory or inappropriate online
      contact is never okay. If in doubt, or if you feel uncomfortable or distressed
      about some interactions you have online, tell a parent or another trusted adult
      immediately. Read more:https://www.unicef.org/media/67396/file/COVID-19%20and%20Its%20Implications%20for%20Protecting%20Children%20Online.pdf

      even greater. It is normal to have disagreements. However, if the disagreements
      become verbal or physical, then it is right to take action.   If you are worried
      about what is happening in your home, or don’t feel safe, talk to a trusted
      adult about what worries you, and seek their advice. During an argument or a
      fight, try not to draw attention to yourself so that you don’t end up getting
      hurt. It might be useful to have a safety plan in case the violence escalates.
      This includes preparing a bag with essential items, like clothing, documents
      and electric charger, and having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified
      to go to should you need to leave the house immediately for safety reasons.
      Arrange with the trusted adult to help you alert the relevant authorities who
      can help you stay safe, including the police, emergency health services and
      social services.  In many of the countries that have been most affected by COVID-19,
      essential services are still available, including shelters or protection services.
      If there are no trusted adults for you to share your concerns with, your country

      household bleach to 49 parts of water). Alcohol at 70-90% can also be used for
      surface disinfection. Surfaces must be cleaned with water and soap or a detergent
      first to remove dirt, followed by disinfection.  Cleaning should always start
      from the least soiled (cleanest) area to the most soiled (dirtiest) area in
      order to not spread the dirty to areas that are less soiled. All disinfectant
      solutions should be stored in opaque containers, in a well-ventilated, covered
      area that is not exposed to direct sunlight and ideally should be freshly prepared
      every day.In indoor spaces, routine application of disinfectants to surfaces
      via spraying is not recommended for COVID-19. If disinfectants are to be applied,
      these should be via a cloth or wipe which is soaked in the disinfectant.
  utter_on_cleaning3:

      and its concentration should be carefully selected to avoid damaging surfaces
      and to avoid or minimize toxic effects on household members (or users of public
      spaces).Avoid combining disinfectants, such as bleach and ammonia, since mixtures
      can cause respiratory irritation and release potentially fatal gases.Keep children,
      pets and other people away during the application of the product until it is
      dry and there is no odour. Open windows and use fans to ventilate. Step away
      from odours if they become too strong. Disinfectant solutions should always
      be prepared in well-ventilated areas.Wash your hands after using any disinfectant,
      including surface wipes. Keep lids tightly closed when not in use. Spills and
      accidents are more likely to happen when containers are open. Do not allow children
      to use disinfectant wipes. Keep cleaning fluids and disinfectants out of the
      reach of children and pets. Throw away disposable items like gloves and masks
      if they are used during cleaning. Do not clean and re-use.Do not use disinfectant
      wipes to clean hands or as baby wipes.The minimum recommended personal protective
      equipment when disinfecting in non-health care settings is rubber gloves, waterproof
      aprons and closed shoes. Eye protection and medical masks may also be needed
      to protect against chemicals in use or if there is a risk of splashing.Note:
      Where cleaning and disinfection are not possible on a regular basis due to resource

      Streets and sidewalks are not considered as routes of infection for COVID-19.
      Spraying disinfectants, even outdoors, can be noxious for people’s health and
      cause eye, respiratory or skin irritation or damage.This practice will be ineffective
      since the presence of dirt or rubbish for example, inactivates the disinfectant,
      and manual cleaning to physically remove all matter is not feasible. This is
      even less effective on porous surfaces such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways.
      Even in the absence of dirt or rubbish, it is unlikely that chemical spraying
      would adequately cover surfaces allowing the required contact time to inactivate
      pathogens.

      ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact. Even if someone who
      is infected with COVID-19 goes through a disinfection tunnel or chamber, as
      soon as they start speaking, coughing or sneezing they can still spread the
      virus.  The toxic effect of spraying with chemicals such as chlorine on individuals
      can lead to eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and potentially
      gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. In addition to health
      safety concerns, the use of chlorine in large-scale spraying practices may prevent

      on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
      Most countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing
      outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing
      their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly
      for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading
      COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your
      hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why?
      Washing your hands with soap andwater or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
      viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre distance between
      yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spray
      small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
      are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,    including the COVID-19 virus
      if the person has the disease.Avoid going to crowded places. Why? Where people
      come together in crowds, you are more likely to come into close contact with
      someone that has COVID-19 and it is more difficult to maintain physical distance
      of 1 metre.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces
      and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to
      your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect
      you.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
      you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately and wash your
      hands. Why? Droplets    spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene,
      you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay
      home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild
      fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave
      your house, wear a mask to avoid infecting others. Why? Avoiding contact with
      others will    protect them from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.If you
      have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call
      by telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of your local
      health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up
      to date information    on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
      allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
      This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep
      up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your
      local and national health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are
      best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect
      themselves.

      (medical or other) in healthy individuals in the wider community. However, WHO
      is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously
      updates its guidance. Medical masks are recommended primarily in health care
      settings, but can be considered in other circumstances (see below). Medical
      masks should be combined with other key infection prevention and control measures
      such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. Healthcare workersWhy? Medical
      masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended for and
      should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients. Close
      contact with people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding
      environment are the main routes of transmission, which means healthcare workers
      are the most exposed. People who are sick and exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19Why?
      Anyone who is sick, with mild symptoms such as muscle aches, slight cough, sore
      throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and use a medical mask according to
      WHO’s recommendation on home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing,
      sneezing or talking can generate droplets that cause can spread the infection.
      These droplets can reach the face of others nearby and land on the surrounding
      environment. If an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks while wearing a
      medical mask, this can help to protect those nearby from infection.If a sick
      person needs to go to a health facility they should wear a medical mask. Anyone
      taking care of a person at home who is sick with COVID-19 Why? Those caring
      for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should wear a medical mask for protection.
      Again, close, frequent and prolonged contact with someone with COVID-19 puts
      caretakers at high risk. National decision makers may also choose to recommend
      medical mask use for certain individuals using a risk-based approach. This approach
      takes into consideration the purpose of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability
      of the wearer, the setting, the feasibility of use and the types of masks to
      be considered.

      the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).Place the mask
      to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to
      the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and
      your chin.Do not touch the mask while you are wearing it for protection.After
      use, take off the mask with clean hands; remove the elastic loops from behind
      the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching
      potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed
      bin immediately after use. Do not reuse the mask.Perform hand hygiene after
      touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly
      soiled, wash your hands with soap and water.Be aware that there is a global
      shortage of medical masks (both surgical masks and N95 masks). These should
      be reserved as much as possible for health care workers. Remember that  masks
      are not a substitute for other, more effective ways to protect yourself and
      others against COVID-19 such as frequently washing your hands, covering your
      cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1

  - text: Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some
      of which havebeen included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful
      guidance in the currentscenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into
      account the type of health careresource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic.
      That is, while the ethical principles thatapply to resource allocation might
      be the same in different pandemics, they can lead todifferent decisions, given
      contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears tosignificantly
      impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics
      arerelevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19.
      As a result, itmay be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that
      have age cut-offs thatdeprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years.When
      applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the
      extent towhich resources are overwhelmed in the current context. It would be
      inappropriate, forinstance, to exclude population groups from being allocated
      a resource (for example,ventilators) at the outset of a pandemic when capacity
      remains. When resources are scarce,though – when there is an insufficient supply
      to meet everyone’s needs – resource allocationshould be guided by well established,
      broadly applicable ethical principles, unless there arecharacteristics of the
      outbreak that justify different courses of action. Irrelevantcharacteristics
      of populations within countries, such as ethnicity, race or creed, should playno
      role in any resource allocation in any pandemic. This reflects our commitment
      to treatingpeople with equal respect.
  utter_on_resource2:
  - text: Generally, the considerations may be different. The allocation of different
      resources may findethical justifications in different principles or values.
      For instance, once a novel vaccine isfound to be safe and effective, to prioritize
      those at highest risk, as well as populations likehealth care workers who may
      be more likely to serve as vectors for transmission, is justified.Within those
      subgroups, some suggest that a lottery-based (i.e., random) allocation may bejustified,
      given that resources will be limited and we can assume nearly equal benefits
      will bederived from any recipient within that group. This is not the case, however,
      for otherresources such as ventilators, where some individuals may derive significantly
      more benefitthan others.
  utter_on_resource3:

      including the principles to be applied, are presented in the below table:Ethical
      considerations when deciding who to prioritizePrincipleDescriptionPractice implicationEqualityEach
      person’s interest should count equally unless there are good reasons that justify
      the differential prioritization of resources.Irrelevant characteristics of individuals,
      such as race, ethnicity, creed, ability or gender, should not serve arbitrarily
      as the basis for the differential allocation of resources.This principle can
      be used to justify the allocation of resources by a lottery – that is, randomly
      by chance – or by a system of first come, first served. May be most appropriate
      to guide the allocation of scarce resources among individuals or populations
      who can be expected to derive the same benefit from the resource, for example,
      vaccines among high-risk populations, or ventilators among those with similar
      clinical indicators for benefit.Best outcomes (utility)This principle can be
      used to justify the allocation of resources according to their capacity to do
      the most good or minimize the most harm, for example, using available resources
      to save the most lives possible.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation
      of scarce resources that confer substantially different benefits to different
      individuals, for example, ventilators to those expected to derive the most benefit.Prioritize
      the worst offThis principle can be used to justify the allocation of resources
      to those in greatest medical need or those most at risk.May be most appropriate
      to guide the allocation of resources that are designed or intended to protect
      those at risk, for example, PPE for health care workers, vaccines for those
      most at risk of infection and severe illness, or those most in need, as in the
      case of provision of drugs in short supply to those needing them most urgently.Prioritize
      those tasked with helping othersThis principle can be used to justify the allocation
      of resources to those who have certain skills or talents that can save many
      other people, or because something is owed to them on account of their participation
      in helping others.May be most appropriate to guide the allocation of resources
      to health care workers, first responders, etc.Allocation principles may be relevant
      or justified at different stages of resource scarcity (from less scarcity to
      more scarcity). For example, where little scarcity exists, the allocation of
      resources such as ventilators may be most justified by the    principle of first
      come, first served (which promotes the value of equality). When those resources
      become increasingly scarce, their allocation may be justified according to a
      principle that prioritizes those most in need. With even greater scarcity,    a
      principle that aims to maximize benefit from the resource may be most justified.
      At each stage, allocation should aim to promote equality – that is, first come,
      first served, or random allocation, when no relevant factors distinguish individuals
      within a particular scheme of allocation (for example, among those with similar
      needs, or among those who can be expected to benefit similarly from the resources,
      or among those that are at similar levels of risk).In addition, multiple principles
      may be combined within an allocation scheme. For example, an allocation scheme
      for PPE might find its justification in a principle prioritizing those most
      at risk as well as a principle prioritizing those tasked with helping    others,
      which would support priority allocation of PPE to health care workers.

  - text: For most decisions, multiple ethical values and principles will be relevant
      to deliberationsabout how to allocate resources. This is likely to generate
      some disagreement, becausedifferent people may weigh the values differently.
      Some may prioritize equality while othersmight put more emphasis on best outcomes
      or prioritization of the worst-off. For this reason,it is imperative that the
      different values be weighed and applied to specific allocation issuesusing a
      fair process.A fair process for allocating scarce resources must promote certain
      ethical values:Transparency. In a transparent process, the decisions and their
      justifications shouldbe made public. This means that the population should be
      informed about the criteriaguiding the decisions.Inclusiveness. Those affected
      by allocation decisions – including individuals,communities or countries – should
      be able to exert at least some influence over thedecision-making process as
      well as the decision itself. This also means that decisions 4should be open
      to challenge and potentially revisable, perhaps through an appealprocess. Consistency.
      Decisions should be consistent so that all persons in the same categoriesare
      treated in the same way. This means that favouritism towards one’s own family,religious
      or political compatriots, or otherwise, is not appropriate. All forms ofcorruption
      that are at variance with this principle should be challenged andcondemned.
      Accountability. Those making decisions about allocation must be accountable
      forthose decisions – that is, they should justify their decisions and be held
      responsible forthem. A fair process means that allocation decisions should not
      be made byindividuals, by individual pharmaceutical companies, or, in the case
      of allocationbetween countries, by a single country. Resources such as vaccines
      and therapiesshould not be stockpiled outside the system of fair allocation.The
      fair allocation of resources is one that is valuable in itself precisely because
      it is fair.However, it may also be valuable because a fair system engenders
      solidarity and trust,which are vital to the successful and sustained collective
      response necessary for dealingeffectively with any outbreak.

      of resource ownership and the prioritization of compatriots. Vaccines should

      other criticalresources should receive some priority in receiving those resources
      because they havealso helped save others by their participation. This is not
      an absolute priority – forexample, it should not take precedence over giving
      priority to those most at risk in thecase of resources such as vaccines.While
      the principle of first come, first served is often applied when allocatingresources
      in health care settings, it is rarely appropriate in an emergency. In practice,it
      is very likely to favour certain groups, such as those closest to a distribution
      centre,those with access to better information, or those who are most well-off.Younger
      populations appear to be at lower risk in the COVID-19 context.Consequently,
      the principle of youngest first should have low priority for vaccine, butperhaps
      may have more weight if they do become sick and need critical careresources.The
      allocation of different resources may find ethical justification in differentprinciples
      or values. For instance, if a novel vaccine is found to be safe and effective,a
      lottery-based allocation may be justified among those as highest risk, the old
      andthose with co-morbidities, if they outnumber available vaccines.Maximizing
      utility should be balanced with the principle of priority to the worst-off:centralizing
      the availability of resources in larger centres may extend their benefits tomore

      good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases,
      patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir

      contact with contaminated surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine
      airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with
      other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g.,

  utter_on_influenza1:
  - text: Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation.
      That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range
      of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.  Secondly,
      both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result,
      the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette
      (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the
      tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.
  utter_on_influenza2:
  - text: The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the
      two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from
      infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time
      between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19
      virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval
      is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further,
      transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic
      transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms –
      is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning
      that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom
      onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The
      reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one
      infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus,
      higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza
      viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children
      are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For
      COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than
      adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further
      preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children
      are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.  While the range of symptoms
      for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to
      be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are
      mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are
      critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical
      infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those
      most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly,
      those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed.
      For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions
      increase the risk for severe infection.  Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher
      than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality
      of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far
      indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided
      by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number
      of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal
      influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a
      large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.

      net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries
      due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will
      leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young
      children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend
      the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including
      ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best
      practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection.

      well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening
      disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a
      fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings
      so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather
      than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly
      progress to severe illness and death.

      for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary

      – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria
      treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit
      of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach
      is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings
      where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA)
      is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity
      during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals
      in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated
      intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease.
      Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of

      This decision follows the publication of a recent Lancet study focusing on the
      effects of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized;
      authors of the study reported a higher mortality rate among patients who received
      the drug.  The Director-General made clear in his announcement that hydroxychloroquine
      continues to be a safe drug for use in patients with malaria and autoimmune

      decision makers to apply a risk-based approach and consider the following:Purpose
      of mask use: if the intention is preventing the wearer transmitting infection
      to others (that is source control) or to offer protection to the wearer against
      infection (that is prevention).Risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to epidemiology/number
      of cases in the population: if there is high community transmission and other
      measures such as contact tracing or ability to carry out testing are not possible.
      depending on occupation: e.g., individuals working in close contact with public
      (e.g., community health worker, cashier).Vulnerability of the mask wearer/population:
      for example, if supplies are adequate medical masks could be used by people
      with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, older
      people, immunocompromised patients.Setting in which the population lives: settings
      with high population density (e.g. refugee camps, those living in cramped conditions)
      and settings where individuals are unable to keep a safe distance (e.g. crowded
      buses or other transport).Feasibility: availability and costs of masks, access
      to clean water to wash non-medical  masks, and ability of mask wearers to tolerate
      adverse effects of wearing a mask. Type of mask: medical mask versus non-medical
      mask (prioritization of medical masks for health care providers, symptomatic
      people and their caregivers).In addition to these factors, potential advantages
      of the use of masks by healthy people in the community setting include reducing
      potential exposure risk from an infected person during the ‘pre-symptomatic’
      period or if an infected person is asymptomatic. There are potential risks and
      disadvantages that should be taken into account in any decision-making process
      on the use of masks:Non-medical or cloth masks could increase potential for
      COVID-19 to infect a person if the mask is contaminated by dirty hands and touched
      often, or kept on other parts of the face or head and then placed back over
      the mouth and noseDepending on the type of mask used, could cause difficulty
      in breathing They can lead to facial skin breakdownThey can lead to difficulty
      with communicating clearly They can be uncomfortable to wear It is possible
      that mask use, with unclear benefits, could create a false sense of security
      in the wearer, leading to diminished practice of recognized beneficial preventive
      measures such as physical distancing and hand hygiene.'

      available as well.   There are numerous designs for fabric masks, but they generally
      cover the nose and mouth, are secured with ties or elastic loops, include multiple
      layers of fabric, and can sometimes be washed and re-used. The evidence about
      the benefits of these masks is limited. One good quality study showed that the
      risk of respiratory infection is increased (and not reduced) in health care
      workers using cotton cloth masks when compared to medical masks. Cloth masks
      are currently being recommended by some countries as a means of source control
      in the general population. Although their protective effectiveness to the wearer
      is unknown, they may protect others if the wearer is a pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic
      carrier.WHO is continuing to gather and review data as new studies become available
      and will update guidance accordingly.

      WHO is actively studying the rapidly evolving science on masks and continuously
      updates its guidance.In the interim, to support countries in their decision-making
      process WHO has provided advice through a risk-based approach for the use of
      masks in the context of COVID-19.
  utter_on_masks5:
  - text: Medical masks are recommended in health care settings. However, it is important
      to remember that the use of masks should be combined with other key infection
      prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing,
      as they do not serve all purposes to protect against COVID-19. WHO recommends
      the use of medical masks for the following individuals:Healthcare workersWhy?
      Medical masks and respirators such as N95, FFP2 or equivalent are recommended
      for and should be reserved for, healthcare workers while giving care to patients.
      Healthcare workers are the most exposed because they are in close contact with
      people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their surrounding environment,
      which are the main routes of transmission. People who are sick and exhibiting
      symptoms of COVID-19Why? Anyone who is sick, even with mild symptoms such as
      muscle aches, slight cough, sore throat or fatigue, should isolate at home and
      use a medical mask as much as possible according to WHO’s recommendation on
      home care of patients with suspected COVID-19. Coughing, sneezing or talking
      can generate droplets that can spread the infection. These droplets can reach
      the face of others nearby or land on the surrounding environment. If an infected
      person coughs, sneezes, or talks wearing a medical mask, this helps to protect
      those nearby from infection.Anyone taking care of a person at home who is sick
      with COVID-19 Why? Those caring for individuals who are sick with COVID-19 should
      wear a medical mask for protection. Close and frequent contact with someone
      with COVID-19 can put those caring for them at high risk. National decision
      makers may also choose to recommend medical mask use for certain individuals
      using a risk-based approach. This approach takes into consideration the purpose
      of the mask, risk of exposure and vulnerability of the wearer, the setting and
      feasibility of use and the types of masks considered. See “Advice on the use
      of masks in the context of COVID-19”.WHO will continue to update guidance according
      to scientific findings.
  utter_on_masks6:
  - text: WHO convenes global teams of experts that collectively review the latest
      studies. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a group of more than 80 experts in
      infection prevention and control from institutions worldwide participate in
      weekly advisory calls to help inform WHO guidance documents. Advice on mask
      use for healthy individuals in community settings was developed in consultation
      with several senior experts.
  utter_on_masks7:
  - text: No, WHO does not recommend the regular use of gloves by people in the community.
      The wearing of gloves may increase risks, since it can lead to self-infection
      or transmission to others through touching contaminated surfaces which is not
      followed by removal of gloves and hand hygiene. Therefore, in public places
      such as supermarkets, in addition to physical distancing, WHO recommends the
      installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit.By widely
      improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the
      COVID-19 virus.
  utter_on_masks8:
  - text: 'Non-medical masks are often homemade of breathable fabrics and can be commercially
      available as well.The evidence about the benefits of these masks is limited.Medical
      masks (also known as surgical masks): these are made from a minimum of three
      layers of synthetic nonwoven materials, and configured to have filtration layers
      sandwiched in the middle. These masks are available in different thicknesses,
      have various levels of fluid-resistance and two levels of filtration. These
      medical masks reduce the transfer of saliva or respiratory droplets from the
      wearer to others and to the environment. They also decrease the likelihood of
      potentially infectious droplets from others reaching the mouth and nose of the
      mask wearer. Hand hygiene should be performed before putting on a clean mask
      and after removing the mask. These masks should be worn tightly around the chin
      and top of the nose. The wearer should avoid touching the mask while it is on
      the face and the mask should be immediately discarded if it becomes moist. Importantly,
      wearing a mask must be combined with other preventive measures including performing
      frequent and appropriate hand hygiene and physical distancing of at least 1
      metre (3 feet).Respirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators --FFR)
      and available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99):
      these are specifically designed for healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19
      patients in settings and areas where special medical procedures are undertaken.   Respirators
      are intended to protect the wearer when these medical procedures aerosolize
      smaller particles than normal droplets into the air in the health treatment
      area.  Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to
      ensure that the respirator is sealed tightly on the wearer’s face and is properly
      fitted. Respirators with valves should not be used as the purpose of source
      control.'
  utter_on_mass_gatherings1:
  - text: High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World
      Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass
      gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s
      definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the
      number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to
      strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community
      where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the
      event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes
      place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health
      system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants
      could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass
      gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country
      with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event
      may not constitute a “mass gathering” event.
  utter_on_mass_gatherings2:
  - text: No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider
      when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision
      to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment
      of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The
      assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the
      health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take
      place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess
      the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency
      services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation.
      It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously
      consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and
      have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice
      of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO
      tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19.
      If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established
      in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting
      mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key
      to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass
      gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.
  utter_on_mass_gatherings3:
  - text: 'For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission
      of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering
      event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and
      becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection
      back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this
      assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should
      recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to
      international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic
      or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are
      determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is
      an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate
      the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the
      community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing
      down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants
      from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should
      be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity,
      its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce
      transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding
      to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might
      place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice
      on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass

      may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or
      may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures
      require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more
      effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to
      collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to
      allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming
      travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake
      this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations

      to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both
      host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty

      Inform yourself of the special measures taken in your community as well as the
      services and the sources of reliable information that are availableduring the
      health emergency  (e.g. home deliveries, psychosocial support, health ministry
      website, alternative access to your pension). Create a list of the basic supplies
      that you will need for at least two weeks and try to get these delivered where
      possible (e.g. non-perishable food items, household products, batteries for
      assistive            devices you may use, and prescription medicines). Alternatively,
      ask family members, caregivers, neighbours or community leaders to help with
      ordering and/or delivery of groceries or prescription medicines. Make sure that
      your mobile phone            credit is topped up and identify a safe place to
      charge your phone regularly so that you can keep in contact with family and
      friends and reach emergency services if needed.   Make a list of emergency numbers
      (e.g. COVID-19 local helpline, nearby hospital and health emergencies numbers,
      hotline for victims of abuse, psychosocial support hotline) and support contacts
      (e.g. family members            and friends, main caregiver, community care
      worker, associations of older persons). If you live alone, you may wish to share
      this list and ask your neighbours, family or caregiver to be in touch regularly,
      for example, by phone or video chat. Discuss with your health-care worker how
      your health needs can be addressed during COVID-19. This may involve postponing
      non-urgent appointments, talking to your doctor or health-care worker by phone
      or video chat instead            of in person and/or revising your vaccination
      schedule. If you rely on the support provided by a caregiver, identify with
      him or her another person that you trust to support your daily living and care
      needs in case your caregiver is unable to continue to provide            care.
      Together, you can note down all the personal care and assistance that you require
      and how it should be provided and share it with this trusted person so that
      they can be ready to provide care in case of need.  If you are the primary caregiver
      of another person who is care dependent (e.g. grandchild, older spouse, child
      with a disability), identify a person that you and the person that you care
      for trust to take on your caregiving responsibilities in case you fall sick.
      Local authorities or volunteer organizations that provide support in these situations
      in your community might be able to help. If multiple people live in your home,
      if possible prepare a separate room or space in your home so that anyone showing
      symptoms compatible with COVID-19 can be isolated from others. If you do not
      have space for self-isolation,            contact your community leaders or
      local health authorities to see if there is community space that could help
      you or other household members self-isolate. Think about what matters most to
      you regarding care and support, including medical treatment, in case something
      happens to you and you are unable to make your own decisions. If you want to
      develop an advanced care plan to record            your treatment and care wishes,
      you can talk about it with your health-care worker or someone that you trust.
      You can write down your wishes and  share them with people you trust.

      trust (e.g. religious/faith leaders, mental health workers or other trusted
